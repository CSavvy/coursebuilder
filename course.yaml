  blurb: |
    Scribbler robots are a great way to get started learning how
    to program. This short course will help you set up Calico, connect to your robot with 
    the Fluke2 add-on through bluetooth, and start programming in Python. It builds upon
    the information put out by the awesome people at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calicoproject.org/Main_Page">Calico Project</a>.
